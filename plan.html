    <h1>Lesson Plans</h1>
    <p>We understand the importance of equipping today's students with the skills they need to navigate the complex digital landscape. This collection of lesson plans are designed to empower you to integrate media literacy education into your classroom.
       While these lessons are targeted to specific age groups, they are very adaptable and relevant to most age groups.

    <h2>Lesson Plan 1: Finding Credible News</h2>
        <p><b>Target age:</b> 11-12-year-olds</p><br>
        <p>The goal of this lesson plan is to ensure that students understand the implications of fake news, and know how to critically analyse whether news sources are credible or not.</p><br>
        <p><b>Warm Up</b></p>
        <p>For this lesson, you will need to access the worksheet linked <a href="pdfs/pdf001-news.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
            This worksheet provides links to real articles all discussing the same topic, showing how the news can be manipulated by different sources.</p>
        <br><p><a href="https://www.commonsense.org/education" target="_blank">Common Sense</a> recommends warming up the class by discussing the idea of fake news stories, they suggest the example of an internet scare that discussed the dangers of the chemical <i>dihydrogen monoxide</i>. 
            We know that this is just another term for water, but the example can show us the impacts of unreliable news and fearmongering.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Handout Time</b></p>
        <p>Use the handout in the way that suits your students' needs and abilities best. You can split them into groups and have one handout per group, or do one handout per student, or project it onto the board and use it for a full class activity.<br>
           <br>Take the class through each article analysing the different biases and opinions different sources may have and analysing the credibility of the source. Allow the students to discuss their inital thoughts, reactions, and comparisons to the material and probe them to evaluate the reliability of each of source.</p>
        <p><br>Whether you decide to use this time for group work, individual work, or class work, a discussion and reflection with the full class should always be prioritised at the end.</p>   
        <br>
        <p><b>Conclusion Exercise</b></p>
        <p>Take the final moments of the class to explain the differences in reliability and between the articles and specifically emphasise the dangers of the final article and its sentiment.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The teacher's version of the handout with example answers and extra tips can be accessed below:</p>

    <h2>Lesson Plan 2: Hoaxes and Fakes</h2>
        <p><b>Target age:</b> 14-15-year-olds</p><br>
        <p>This lesson specifically aims to inform students on the dangers of misinformation and disinformation, understanding advancements in AI and other generated content that might be difficult to identify as fake.</p><br>
        <p><b>Warm Up</b></p>
        <p>To warm up for this lesson, allow 15 minutes to watch and discuss the videos linked in this lessons slides below.</p>
        <p>The videos show the importance of intent and context when creating and sharing information and content online.</p>

        <br>
        <p><b>Exploring Lateral Reading</b></p>
        <p>Using the video below and the <a href="pdfs/pdf003-hoax.pdf" target="_blank">lesson worksheet</a>, introduce the concept of lateral reading and how it can help differentiate between credible information and misinformation. Lateral reading describes using multiple sources and sites to come to a conclusion about a specific story or piece of content.<br>
           <br>Lateral reading aims to encourage users to reject the norm of vertical reading i.e. scrolling on a singular page to find more information and instead use multiple sources to verify and confirm information.</p>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GoQG6Tin-1E?si=uBY15LI3jB-EVLPQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
       <p><b>Conclusion Exercise</b></p>
       <p>The final pages of the <a href="pdfs/pdf003-hoax.pdf" target="_blank">worksheet</a> links to three internet videos. Your students' job is to, either individually or in groups, determine which videos are real and which are fakes or hoaxes using the skills they have learnt during the lesson.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Lesson Plan 3: Filter Bubble Trouble</h2>
        <p><b>Target age:</b> 17-18-year-olds</p><br>
        <p>This lesson seeks to teach students about online filter bubbles and the power of algorithms limiting what content they see online.</p><br>
        <p><b>Warm Up</b></p>
        <p>The lesson should begin with a discussion of the term filter bubble and what living in a bubble means. Allow the students to discuss what it means to live in a bubble and then help them to define what a filter bubble is using the video below:</p>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/doWZHFnVPQ8?si=Rm78nMHzn8hYE6Vk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p><b>Exploring and Bursting the Filter Bubble</b></p>
        <p>Using the <a href="pdfs/pdf005-bubble.pdf" target="_blank">worksheet</a> and Eli Pariser's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8ofWFx525s" target="_blank">TED Talk</a>, ask your students to take some notes on the video and answer the questions provided in the <a href="pdfs/pdf005-bubble.pdf" target="_blank">worksheet</a>.</p>
        <br><p>After exploring and understanding the creation and problems with filter bubbles, the lesson will focus on how to 'burst' the filter bubble. Using the worksheet, ask students to reflect on what content they see and what is in their filter bubble, as well as what they don't see and what specific opinions might not be represented in their feeds.</p>
        <br><p>Engaging with opinions and views not aligned with their own broadens the students' knowledge and understanding of different topics, helping them to question and be critical of their own beliefs.</p>
